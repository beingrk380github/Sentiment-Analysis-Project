# Sentiment Analysis Project 
# AUTHOR : RAMBABU KUMAR 

This project implements a sentiment analysis system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques. It processes textual data to determine sentiment polarity—positive, negative, or neutral.

The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and a Flask-based API for deployment.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze textual data and classify it based on sentiment. It involves:

- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Training machine learning models for sentiment classification
- Developing a RESTful API using Flask for model deployment
- Providing a user-friendly interface for sentiment prediction

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing text data for analysis
- **Model Training**: Implementing and evaluating various machine learning models
- **API Development**: Creating a Flask API for serving model predictions
- **User Interface**: HTML templates to interact with the prediction service

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks**:
  - Pandas, NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - NLTK
  - Flask
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beingrk380github/Sentiment-Analysis-Project.git
   cd Sentiment-Analysis-Project
(Optional) Create a virtual environment:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
# Activate the environment:
source venv/bin/activate        # On macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # On Windows
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Train the model (optional):
Open Data Exploration & Modelling.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook to explore data and train the model.

Run the Flask app:

bash
Copy
Edit
python api.py
This will start the API server at http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Use the interface:
Go to the URL in your browser and input a sentence to analyze its sentiment.

Results
The trained model provides reliable sentiment classification. Detailed accuracy, confusion matrix, and plots are available inside the Jupyter Notebook.
