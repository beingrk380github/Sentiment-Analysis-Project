Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/beingrk380github/Sentiment-Analysis-Project.git
cd Sentiment-Analysis-Project
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
Edit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install the required packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Exploration and Model Training:
Open the Jupyter Notebook Data Exploration & Modelling.ipynb to explore the dataset and train models.

Run the Flask API:

bash
Copy
Edit
python api.py
The API will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Access the User Interface:
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your web browser to use the sentiment prediction interface.

Results
The trained model achieves satisfactory accuracy in classifying sentiments. Detailed evaluation metrics and visualizations are available in the Jupyter Notebook.
